What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git environment is created without commits. (.git folder is created and master branch).
You need it to make commits and have all git stuff. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

In stage area you specific what files of current working directory
you want to move by commit on repository.
It gaves you control on commits - you can commit chosen
files as one and other as another one.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

You can control what file you want to add to specific commit
