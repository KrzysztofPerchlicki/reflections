When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If you want to share your work with others, gets reviews and so on...

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If you work on something and then  somebody add some changes on repository
You don't want to pull cause it can make some conflicts with your actual code.
Pulling when you want gives you more control and safety.
